# Traveling in BFS/DFS
A fun and practical way to display Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search with pathfinding on a grid for a school project. 

## Project Objectives

- [x] Editing a graph
- [x] Coloring a graph
- [x] Breadth-First Search traversal
- [x] Depth-First Search traversal
- [ ] Determining the shortest path between two given nodes (NULL if no path is possible)

## Prerequisites
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/)

## Building
